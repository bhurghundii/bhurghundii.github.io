I love the concept of home cooked software and gleefully engage in the practice. As someone with ADHD, I wanted to show off two apps I vibecoded to help me cope with some of the shortcomings I experience.

# Pick One At Random

This app randomly decides something from a list of items that don't really matter.

Pick One At Random started out as an app to help pick me out clothes to wear for that day. I used to sit there wasting 15-20 minutes figuring what works. Later on, I expanded it so it could decide what food to order out if I wanted to order out, what art warm up I wanted to do etc.

It's free and runs locally: https://pickoneatrandom.com/

# ADHD Tax

I kept getting parking tickets at the same parking lot. I needed reminders based on location. I don't care if I see an alert again - as long as something flagged up to tell me: BURGUNDY PAY YOUR PARKING TICKET BEFORE YOU LEAVE!!!

The best solution at the time I had were Apple Reminders. They are limited in the sense that the reminders need to happen whenever I go to the parking lot and I don't know when I am going so it is a bit of a headache. When I screw up, I tend to make expensive screw ups. Like £360 spent last year in just parking fines.

I made it so when I am good and remember to do things, I also track how much I save for the week. It genuinely brings me a lot of joy.
