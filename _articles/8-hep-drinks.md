I have a tendency to get into things as a way to slow me down or when the world is just too intense for me. I tend to do this in cycles: usually I stop whenever the world has moved on. A cycle can last several weeks to a couple of months.

I caught myself slipping into my 4th cycle. This first time I noticed that I do this. I am very proud of myself for picking up on this. I don't like waking up hungover or waking up at 1PM. I want to be creative and do things, and that's really hard to do when you are at 30% all the time and only living 5-6 hours a day.

To make matters worse, on top of substance abuse, I realised I had "soft" addictions. Things that are bad but are not considered addictions. Like YouTube or finding Reddit posts that validate my feelings. I have been off for 2 weeks now. 

1. Sobriety is worth it, even if it's a literal headache.
2. Actually acknowledge your actual feelings towards the situation. Don't be polite.
3. Environment is easier to control than will power. Design your environment so you succeed.
4. Pick friends who want to be around sober you. 
5. Life gets very intense once you stop. Be ready and not one step back.
6. Your phone is not for work. Anyone who claims so is lying.
7. Don't be polite.
