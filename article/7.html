<p>I love the concept of home cooked software and gleefully engage in the practice. As someone with ADHD, I wanted to show off two apps I vibecoded to help me cope with some of the shortcomings I experience.</p>
<h1 id="pick-one-at-random"tabindex="-1">Pick One At Random</h1>
<p>This app randomly decides something from a list of items that don’t really matter.</p>
<p>Pick One At Random started out as an app to help pick me out clothes to wear for that day. I used to sit there wasting 15-20 minutes figuring what works. Later on, I expanded it so it could decide what food to order out if I wanted to order out, what art warm up I wanted to do etc.</p>

<p>It’s free and runs locally: <a href="https://pickoneatrandom.com/">https://pickoneatrandom.com/</a></p>
<h1 id="adhd-tax"tabindex="-1">ADHD Tax</h1>
<p>I kept getting parking tickets at the same parking lot. I needed reminders based on location. I don’t care if I see an alert again - as long as something flagged up to tell me: BURGUNDY PAY YOUR PARKING TICKET BEFORE YOU LEAVE!!!</p>
<p>The best solution at the time I had were Apple Reminders. They are limited in the sense that the reminders need to happen whenever I go to the parking lot and I don’t know when I am going so it is a bit of a headache. When I screw up, I tend to make expensive screw ups. Like £360 spent last year in just parking fines.</p>
<p>I made it so when I am good and remember to do things, I also track how much I save for the week. It genuinely brings me a lot of joy.</p>
