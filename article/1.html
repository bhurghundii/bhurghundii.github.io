<p>I have been obsessed with Jimi Hendrix’s rendition of Killing Floor. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHuGoI3kPa4&amp;t=1s">Very specifically in this performance.</a></p>
<p>I am not really certain where the performance took place (I think it’s Monterey), but while Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell are getting ready, Jimi impatiently starts playing Killing Floor.</p>
<p>Killing Floor is not an easy song to play</p>
<h1 id="too-difficult-to-play-live"tabindex="-1">Too difficult to play live</h1>
<p>This is what Eric Clapton said on Killing Floor</p>
<p>I have tried to play Killing Floor and the only way I can do it while keeping up with the pace (at the expense of it sounding awful) is by barring the 5th and 7th fret and switching super quickly to get some semblance of what I am hearing.</p>
<p>The best cover for this is by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyGnW4b4cP8">this guy</a>, who absolutely kills it</p>
<h1 id="what-makes-this-so-special"tabindex="-1">What makes this so special</h1>
<p>First off, that’s the Jimi Hendrix Experience. By far one of the most talented set of musicians in the 60s and Jimi just decides to go for it while they are setting up. What he does is special: it sounds like there are 2 guitars playing but it’s literally just Jimi playing the lead and the bass part at the same (I think it’s to do with the timing and the suggestion of the bass notes??) but then Noel kicks in and just matches Jimi’s energy. It’s such an amazing moment of spontaneity and they all just meet each other’s energy so well.</p>
<p>The closest thing I’ve seen to this in more recent times
I’d probably have to go with Masego and FKJ’s Tadow. You can just tell they meet each other musically. It’s an amazing duet and the fact it was all done in one take, just is nuts.</p>
